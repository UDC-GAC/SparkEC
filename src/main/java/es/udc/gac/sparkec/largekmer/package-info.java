/**
 * <p>
 * This package will contain the Phase, SubPhases and auxiliary classes used at the LargeKmerFilter Phase.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is the first filtering Phase, and it's purpose is to tag the nodes with ignore data that allows 
 * to more efficiently do their computations, skipping those kmers that will be invalid.
